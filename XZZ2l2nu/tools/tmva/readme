TMVA training and applying

1.) training

./xzzbdt.py

need to modify the script to point to the ntuple input directory,
the input ntuples are skimmed using tools in 

   XZZ2l2nu/tools/selections

to add the SumWeights and SumEvents inside the tree.


2.) applying

./addbdtvar.sh

it is eventually another skimming but add new branches to the trees storing the MVA variables inside.


3.) plotting

./stack_dtmc.py

Note that this script is modified version that takes the trees outputted from step 2.) .
